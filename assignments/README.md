# Assignments

The examination of the course Control Theory, followed by master students Mechanical Engineer at the KU Leuven, is based on practical assignments in which several techniques taught during the course are applied on the mecotron.

The assignments are grouped in four parts:

1. Identification and velocity control of the DC motors
2. Position control of the cart on a line
3. Control of an inverted pendulum
4. Implementation of a Kalman filter estimating the position and orientation of the cart and control of the cart in the plane

As an illustration, the result of assignment 3 is illustrated in the following video:
