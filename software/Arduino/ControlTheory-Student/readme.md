CONTROL THEORY STUDENT
======================

This project forms the bare bone from which students should start. The robot-class contains 2 motors, 2 encoders, 2 distance sensors and a pendulum, which need not all be used. The controllerhook() is running at a rate of 100Hz and should be used to run a control algorithm. It is mainly the student's job to write down a control law within this controllerhook.
