This repository gathers software and hardware details on mobile platforms that were recently designed in support of an introductory control course.

Through dedicated assignments, students are guided to implement and validate all parts of the course on a setup, ranging from basic time-domain system identification, over root locus analysis and loop shaping PID design, to state feedback, state estimation and Kalman filtering.

The designed platforms are flexible, allowing for numerous extensions and variations; cheap, allowing for a large pool of setups from which the students can borrow platforms to take home; and of sufficient quality, allowing the students to get maximal insight in the course material.

The platforms are furthermore easy to set up and administer using the supporting material.
